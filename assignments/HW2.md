> Review the presentation on papers Q and R using the following criteria: technical accuracy of review, presentation (easy to understand, examples), analysis and insights beyond the paper summary available on textbook web-site. You are expected to upload the electronic copy of your 500 word narrative (for each paper) summarizing the findings as well as a list of 3 to 4 specific improvements onto your class webpage. 

## CP2
> Identify key sources, types of evidence. Include a list of sources. The potential source for the paper is a recent conference proceedings or a journal in the data science area. Students should visit library, web (e.g. Google Scholar, DBLP, ACM DL, IEEE DL for papers and amazon.com for book) and fellow students specializing in the data science research area, to check the availability of the sources before listing them. Provide summary of search results from DBLP and amazon.com to illustrate the effort. 

## CP3
> Summary of key readings. This summary is more than a list of summaries for individual research papers using the hints in the section on analyzing a research paper. A possible approach is to find a common abstract problems adressed by all the paper and develop a simple classification system to compare the solutions proposed in individual papers. Look at the "literature survey" sections of the papers in the reading list (particularly the thsoe from ACM Computing Surveys) for examples. Provide the summary of key readings in three formats: 
> 1) a laundry list, 
> 2) a decision table and 
> 3) a decision tree.

> Make the entire slidedeck digital accessible, including providing descriptions of images, tables and identifying the reading order. For more details, see the Digital Accessibility Resource Guide. You can use the built-in Accessibility Checker in Microsoft Powerpoint to check your progress. To do this, go to the Review tab, and then to Accessibility Checker. A side panel will open and review the slide deck. Check the side panel after each slide.
