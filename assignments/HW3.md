## CA5
> Revise your presentation on paper P using the feedback from reviewers. Prepare a 500 word narrative summarizing the revisions for suggested improvements from reviewers. Place the revised presentation and narrative on the web and ensure that the course web-site has a link to your material. 

## CA6
> Submit two questions to test the understanding of key concepts in P in a closed-book examination. Attach model solutions to each questions. Each question should be answerable in 10 minutes. Questions should be problem-solving in nature with a unique answer. Questions can be similar to the quiz from the presentation. If similar, provide a 75-100 word justification of the answer, explaining why the choices are correct or incorrect.

## CP4
> Possible outline or overall structure for paper / project. Do include a justification comparing and contrasting your proposed paper / project with the summary of key readings. There should be a clear statement of the new aspects of your work. Look at the "literature survey and our contribution" sections of the papers in the reading list for examples. 

## CP5
> ### Midterm Slides: 
> The slides should summarized Heilmeir Questions such that each questions should be addressed in 1-2 slides.
> The questions are as follows:
> - What are you trying to do ?: Problem Statement (1 slide)
> - If we succeed, what difference do we think it will make ?: Significance of the problem (1 slide)
> - Why is it hard ?: Challenges (1 slide)
> - How does this get done, at present ?: Related Work and Our Contributions (1-2 slides)
> - What is the new technical idea ? : Propsoed Approach (1-2 slide)
> - Validation of listed contribution (experimental, analytical) (1-2 slides)
> - Conclusions and Future Work (1 slide)
> - Weekly Plan and Task (1 slide)
> ### Validation Slide: 
>Choose a methodology similar to the ones used in the papers in the reading list. For example, experiments, analytial methods, case study, detailed illustrative examples, prototyping and demonstration of new capability, etc. There should be a clear plan to list the steps within each methodology. For example an experimental methodology should include a description of the experiment design listing the candidates to be compared, metrics of performance, values of fixed parameters, valuesets for variable parameters, benchmark datasets and computations, key assumptions, etc. ([Proposal example](https://www.spatial.cs.umn.edu/Courses/Spring26/8715/course_project/CP5_proposal.pdf), [Mid-term presentation example](https://www.spatial.cs.umn.edu/Courses/Spring26/8715/course_project/CP5_slides.pdf))
> ###  Weekly Plan Slide: 
> This slide should contain a table with 5 rows and 2 columns, where the column names are 'Weeks' and 'Task'. Each row will be filled with a 'Week' (e.g., 2/25 - 3/3) and a 'Task' (e.g., running experiments, etc.).
> ### Formal Proposal: 
> The proposal should encompass all slides, detailing the Heilmeier questions along with a weekly plan. It should include an introduction that briefly covers all six elements, along with the contributions.
