## CA2
> Identify two other papers (say Q and R) chosen for class presentation by other groups. You team will peer-review presentations prepared by other teams on Q and R.

### Paper Q:  [Foundation Models for Scientific Discovery and Innovation](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/29212/chapter/1)

### Paper R:  [A Survey on Uncertainty Quantiifcation Methods for Deep Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3786319)

## CA3
> Submit an electronic copy (plain text or other standard format files) of the narrative and slides. Use file formats (e.g. powerpoint, pdf), which are supported widely by browsers. Electronic copy will be linked to the web-page for the course to make those available to the audience. The written critique should be about 1500 ~ 2000 words long and the oral presentation should consist of about 10 slides addressing the following questions:
>- Problem statement: Formally define the problem addressed in the paper. Briefly explain the significance of the problem in context of our course.
>- List the major contributions of the paper. Which do you think is most significant and why?
>- What are the key concepts behind the approach in this paper. Provide simple explanations of those. Also provide a couple of simple exercises for the audience to check their undersanding of the key concepts.
>- What is the validation methodology (e.g. case studies, statistical hypothesis testing, proofs, simulation) used in this paper? Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology. Why did authors choose this methodology?
>- List the assumptions made by the authors. Critique an assumption that you believe is unreasonable. What is the impact of removing this unreasonable assumption on the solution proposed by the authors?

We will submit a file once we are able to observe the presentations of each paper, and their slides are made available on their respective project websites.

## CP1
> Define possible questions, i.e. preliminary proposal outlining areas of interest based on the examination of course material. The question should be related to a topic covered in the course but not completely addressed by the papers in the reading list.

- What is the primary purpose for introducing the framework of the paper?
- List the underlying mathematics or engineering used for the paper's architecture.  How do they contribute to the paper's main contribution(s)?  How is their application unique or novel, if it is?
- What are the intended applications of the paper?  Were any demonstrated in the paper, or can be seen in the real world today?
- What assumptions can be infered from the paper, and are they reasonable?  If the paper is relatively old, were any of the assumptions misplaced or are now widely accepted?
- Where do(es) the paper's author(s) expect refinements or further research and applications to be made?  Are there refinements they could be missing?  If it is an older paper, what refinements have been made since?

## DA1
> Each group will be assigned a week of class notes to work on. Generate alternative text for the first 5 images in the slide deck. To do this, download the slide deck from the "Slides" column of the Notes table for the assigned week. To generate alternative text for an image in the slide deck, simply download the image and upload it to the Image Accessibility Generator. To insert an alternative text, right click an image in the slide and select "Edit Alt Text ..." in the drop down menu in Microsoft Powerpoint.

![First Image](image1.png)
*Long Description:*

*The image illustrates a binary search tree diagram. At the top level, the word "Search tree" is displayed. Below it, there are two legends: a filled circle indicating a "Tree node pointer" and an empty circle indicating a "Null tree pointer." The tree structure begins with the root node labeled "5," connected by arrows pointing to its left and right child nodes. The left child node, labeled "3," further points to its own left child, labeled "1." On the right side of the root, the node "6" points to its right child, labeled "9." The node "9" has two children: "7" on the left and "8" on the right. The node "9" also points to the value "12" on the far right. Each node is represented by a small rectangle with two or three compartments, indicating the tree pointer structure.*

![Second Image](image2.png)

*"Long Description:*

*The image contains two diagrams labeled as (a) and (b), depicting hierarchical structures likely related to data organization in trees. Diagram (a) illustrates a tree node structure with boxes aligned horizontally. Boxes labeled ( P_1, K_1 ) are followed by ellipses indicating more elements (( K_{i-1}, P_i, K_i )), ending with ( K_{q-1}, P_q ). Below each of these labels are triangles marked ( X ), connected by arrows labeled "Tree pointer," with conditions like ( X \leq K_1 ) and ( K_i < X ). Diagram (b) depicts a sequence of boxes labeled ( K_1, P_{r1} ), continuing with ellipses until ( K_{q-1}, P_{r(q-1)} ), ending with ( P_{\text{next}} ). Arrows beneath indicate "Data pointer" relating to each series of ( K ) and ( Pr ) pairs. An arrow labeled "Pointer to next leaf node in tree" points right from ( P_{\text{next}} ).*

![Third Image](image3.png)

*Long Description:*

*The image shows a grid with both x and y axes labeled from 0 to 7. The grid contains a red, continuous line representing a spatial filling curve, winding through small squares in a pattern across the entire grid. Several black dots are plotted along the path of the curve at specific coordinates. Letters label each dot from A to H. The overall path of the curve appears to fill the grid in a systematic way. The top of the image contains the title "Spatial filling curve."*

![Fourth Image](image4.png)

*Long Description:*

*The image is a diagram labeled "R-tree," depicting a hierarchical structure of rectangular nodes and sub-rectangles, presumably representing spatial data. The layout is divided into two main sections, separated by a dashed horizontal line labeled "x" and "y." Each section contains several labeled sub-rectangles. In the top section, labeled "a," "b," "c," and "d," there are nine smaller rectangles labeled from 1 to 9. The bottom section contains rectangles labeled "e," "f," "g," and sub-rectangles numbered 10 through 16. The rectangles are shaded, with some overlapping or nested within larger dashed borders that group them into categories.*

![Fifth Image](image5.png)

*Long Description:*

*The image depicts a binary tree structure with nodes connected by lines, illustrating a hierarchical arrangement. At the top is the node labeled "R," which branches into two nodes labeled "X" and another node ("e") on the right side. The node "X" further branches into four nodes labeled "a," "b," "c," and "d." On the right side of "R," the node "e" connects to two other nodes labeled "f" and "g." Each leaf node contains numbers within brackets, representing data associated with each node. The connections form a clear and structured pattern typical of tree data structures.*
