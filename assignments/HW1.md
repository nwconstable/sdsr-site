## CA2
> Identify two other papers (say Q and R) chosen for class presentation by other groups. You team will peer-review presentations prepared by other teams on Q and R.

### Paper Q:  [Foundation Models for Scientific Discovery and Innovation](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/29212/chapter/1)

### Paper R:  [A Survey on Uncertainty Quantiifcation Methods for Deep Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3786319)

## CA3
> Submit an electronic copy (plain text or other standard format files) of the narrative and slides. Use file formats (e.g. powerpoint, pdf), which are supported widely by browsers. Electronic copy will be linked to the web-page for the course to make those available to the audience. The written critique should be about 1500 ~ 2000 words long and the oral presentation should consist of about 10 slides addressing the following questions:
- Problem statement: Formally define the problem addressed in the paper. Briefly explain the significance of the problem in context of our course.
- List the major contributions of the paper. Which do you think is most significant and why?
- What are the key concepts behind the approach in this paper. Provide simple explanations of those. Also provide a couple of simple exercises for the audience to check their undersanding of the key concepts.
- What is the validation methodology (e.g. case studies, statistical hypothesis testing, proofs, simulation) used in this paper? Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology. Why did authors choose this methodology?
- List the assumptions made by the authors. Critique an assumption that you believe is unreasonable. What is the impact of removing this unreasonable assumption on the solution proposed by the authors?

## CP1
> Define possible questions, i.e. preliminary proposal outlining areas of interest based on the examination of course material. The question should be related to a topic covered in the course but not completely addressed by the papers in the reading list.

- What is the primary purpose for introducing PyG 2.0 over PyG (Pytorch Geometric)?
- List the underlying mathematics used for PyG 2.0's architecture.  How do they contribute to PyG 2.0's construct?  How is their use different from the initial PyG architecture?
- What applications can PyG 2.0 be used for?  Are the applications theoretical or practical?  Were any demonstrated in the paper?

## DA1
> Each group will be assigned a week of class notes to work on. Generate alternative text for the first 5 images in the slide deck. To do this, download the slide deck from the "Slides" column of the Notes table for the assigned week. To generate alternative text for an image in the slide deck, simply download the image and upload it to the Image Accessibility Generator. To insert an alternative text, right click an image in the slide and select "Edit Alt Text ..." in the drop down menu in Microsoft Powerpoint.
