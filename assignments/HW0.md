## CA1
> Browse the [reading list](https://www.spatial.cs.umn.edu/Courses/Spring26/8715/index.php?page=./reading_list){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Identify two research papers (papers marked with "CAP-RP (New)") and two survey papers ("CAP-SP"). For each category (i.e., "CAP-RP (New)" or "CAP-SP"), one paper should be from topics 1-8 and the other from topics 9-15. These are the choices from your group for the class presentation (that your group will do after critically analyzing one of the papers that we assign). Identify the team member responsible for 1500 ~ 2000 word narrative on the selected paper. Identify the team member responsible for preparing 10 slides and the oral presentation in lecture. From the choices that you gave us, we will identify one paper, called Paper-1, for your group based on the need to spread out presentation across all weeks, and choice made by all students.
